## Features

### Freelancer

- The platform allows freelancers to create deals by filling out a form with their name and the price of their service.
- Once the freelancer completes the work, they can "commit" the deal on the blockchain, which updates the status of the deal to "done."
- One freelancer can work under only one employer at a time.

### Employer

- Employers can then choose a freelancer and pay for the service by sending the agreed-upon amount of cryptocurrency to the smart contract.
- At a time, Employer can deal with only one freelancer.
- Review the completed project and close it.
- Finally, the employer can "close" the deal, which sends the payment from the smart contract to the freelancer.
